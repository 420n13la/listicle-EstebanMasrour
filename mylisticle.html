		<section>
			<p>Python is a simplistic language that has plenty of uses. It is often used by data scientists who use it to create machine learning algorithms and is one of the most used languages today.</p>
			<blockquote>
			<q>The joy of coding Python should be in seeing short, concise, readable classes that express a lot of action in a small amount of clear code -- not in reams of trivial code that bores the reader to death.</q>
			<p>- Guido van Rossum</p>

		<h2>2. Java</h2>

		<section>
			<p>Java is an older language that is not too difficult to learn and has many uses. It's main usage is to create applications for desktop and mobile devices. Thanks to its age, there has plenty of resources available for it and remains a popular language to this day.</p>
			<blockquote>
				<q>When you write a program for Android, you use the Oracle Java tools for everything, and at the very end, you push a button and say, 'Convert this to Android format.'</q>

		<section>
			<p>C# is an older language that is very similar to Java. It can also be used to create desktop applications but is also used to make games. It's not as popular as Java but it isn't all too different.</p>
			<blockquote>
				<q>Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, itâ€™s bad.</q>
